Why?
. To evaluate and compare RiotJS with ReactJS implementation
. RiotJS supposed to be 10 times smaller and faster compared to ReactJS

What else I need to know?
. To ensure compatibility between the future's Web Component, please define all custom element names with more than one words separated by a hypen e.g. my-first-element!

Swagger Client
. The JavaScript client is based on https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-client

FalcorJS
. It is experimental and it is not ready (due to a need to have the JSON response in a form of JSONGraph mainly)
